Package: icd9
Title: Tools for Working with ICD-9 Codes, and Finding Comorbidities
Description: This package allows accurate manipulation, validation and
    comparison of ICD-9-CM (clinical modification) codes. Although ICD-9 codes
    appear numeric, this is not the case, since trailing zeroes, and a mixture
    of decimal and non-decimal "short" format codes exist. Tools to map ICD-9
    codes to co-morbidities are also provided, with mappings from Quan (Deyo
    and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ included.
